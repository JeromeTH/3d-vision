# Vision Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains **Jerome Hsu’s** solutions to **Wei-Chiu Ma’s** computer vision problem set.

## Overview

The work includes Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX writeups, and supplementary figures illustrating key steps in the assignments. Each task focuses on understanding and implementing core computer vision concepts such as:

- Camera models and projection geometry  
- Image warping and perspective transformations  
- Epipolar geometry and 3D reconstruction  
- Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and NeRF-based dense reconstruction
