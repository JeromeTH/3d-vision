\begin{document}
A set of parallel lines is parallel to the ray connecting the optical center and their vanishing point. 
If the vanishing point appears at pixels $(x, y)$ on the image with optical center $(x_c, y_c)$, then 
the ray is characterized by the homogenous coordinates
$$ 
\begin{bmatrix}
    x - x_c \\
    y - y_c \\ 
    f
\end{bmatrix}
$$

(assuming aspect ratio of 1). 
We also know that two rays may be orthogonal in 3D space is the lines parallel to each of them are orthogonal. 
Thus, let $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ be the vanishing points of two orthogonal set of parallel lines, 
we have 
\begin{align*}
    (x_1 - x_c, y_1 - y_c, f) \cdot (x_2 - x_c, y_2 - y_c, f) = 0 \Leftrightarrow\\
    f^2 = -(x_1 - x_c)(x_2 - x_c) - (y_1 - y_c)(y_2 - y_c)
\end{align*}
